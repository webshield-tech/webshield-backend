           AI SECURITY ANALYSIS
======================================================================

**Scan Results Analysis**

**Target URL:** https://google.com/
**Scan Tool:** nikto
**Scan Time:** 1/5/2026, 11:55:16 AM

**Port/Service Assessment:**
- Target Port: 80 (HTTP) - This is a standard port for HTTP traffic. It's safe if the site is using HTTPS (which is the case here, as the site redirects to https://www.google.com/).

**Findings:**

* **The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set:** This could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type. This is a potential security risk, as it may allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Cookie __Secure-STRP created without the httponly flag:** This means that the cookie is vulnerable to being accessed by malicious scripts running on the client-side. This is a potential security risk.
* **Server banner changed from 'gws' to 'sffe':** This indicates that the server is using a load balancer or a content delivery network (CDN). This is not a security risk in itself, but it may indicate that the site is using a complex infrastructure.

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. **Set the X-Content-Type-Options header:** This will prevent the user agent from rendering the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
2. **Set the httponly flag for the __Secure-STRP cookie:** This will prevent malicious scripts from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of session hijacking.
3. **Review the server configuration:** While the server banner change is not a security risk in itself, it may indicate that the site is using a complex infrastructure. Reviewing the server configuration may help identify any potential security risks.

**Overall Safety:** Overall, this site appears safe because it uses HTTPS, but there are some potential security risks that need to be addressed.
